# Python Projects: Password Manager & Malicious IP Address Identifier

This repository showcases two Python projects I developed to demonstrate my coding skills and knowledge of security concepts.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Password Manager
The **Password Manager** is a secure tool that helps users store and manage passwords for different accounts. It utilizes **AES encryption** to protect the passwords, ensuring that sensitive information is stored securely. The program uses a **master password** to unlock the encrypted password vault.

#### Features:
- Store and retrieve passwords securely.
- AES encryption for data protection.
- Simple user interface for adding and retrieving password entries.
- Supports multiple entries for usernames, passwords, and URLs.

### 2. Malicious IP Address Identifier
The **Malicious IP Address Identifier** helps identify suspicious or malicious IP addresses. It checks an IP address against known blacklists and threat intelligence databases to determine whether it is involved in harmful activities like hacking attempts or spamming.

#### Features:
- Check if an IP address is listed on public blacklists.
- Helps detect potentially malicious activity based on the IP address.
- Useful for network administrators and security researchers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Cryptography** (for AES encryption in the Password Manager)
- **Requests** (for querying external services to check malicious IPs)
- **JSON** (for securely storing and retrieving password data)

## Purpose
This repository is part of my personal portfolio to demonstrate my ability to develop Python programs with an emphasis on:
- Implementing secure systems (e.g., encryption, password management).
- Working with external APIs and threat intelligence data.
- Writing clean, readable, and efficient Python code.
